	<p style = "font-family: bookman old style"> My name is Manell Jia Dael. I am a sophomore in college. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and that I 
		like to study. My favorite subject is Mathematics that's why I took Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with specialization in Computer Application at 
		De La Salle University - Manila. I want to become a respected professional in one of the fields. I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working 
		student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. 
		I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study and the students are very friendly and ready to help. I like to receive and deal with challenging 
		tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine. My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with 
		a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I believe that friendship is one 
		of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I 
		appreciate friendship and people who surround me. Last, but not the least, I am a big fan of KathNiel and Taylor Swift! </p>
